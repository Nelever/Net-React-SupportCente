In this project I used React as a frontend, ASP.NET Api as backend and MS SQL Server as database connected by EntityFramework.

Database is hosted so to test this project you just need to clone it
How to view this project:

Requirements : 
Visual studio 2022
Node

Start visual studio ,click "Clone a repository" and use this link https://github.com/Nelever/Net-React-SupportCenter.git .
After project has loaded restart visual studio. It will get rid of  "Plugin react was conflicted...." error. Project will work despite it so it s optional.

You can use user account with login: 1test@gmail.com password: 1234 or create new one.
To test moderator account login: 2345 password: 1234 .

This is project of support center where users with some kind of problem can get help from moderators. User account can view it s tickets send messages in open tickets and create new ticket. Moderator account can view tickets assigned to itself and not assigned tickets to assign them to itself. With assigned ticket moderator can write a message or close ticket.
